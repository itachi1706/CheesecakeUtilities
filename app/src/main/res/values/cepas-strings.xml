    TRANSLATORS: Shown in a pop-up dialog, when "localise_places_longdesc_button" is pressed.
    "LocaleSpan" is the name of an Android API, and should not be translated. "Google TalkBack" is
    the name of Android's standard screen-reader software.
***REMOVED***
    <string name="localise_places_longdesc">Text-to-speech voices normally only work well for one language.\n\nLocaleSpan hints are used to mark text as being in a different language. When applied to a station, stop, line or route name, a screen reader that supports these hints will pronounce the name using synthesized voices from the place\'s native language, rather than the language you have configured Android to use.\n\nEnabling this option generally improves the pronunciation of foreign place names that are not internationally renowned, but you might find it more difficult to understand.\n\nThis does not normally change the on-screen display of place names, but some devices may use a different font.\n\nThis requires accessibility software that supports the LocaleSpan API (such as Google TalkBack), and that you have appropriate voices installed.</string>

    This tile server gives "retina" tiles which are much nicer on modern
    smartphones.

    Metrodroid has been granted permission to use the tile server by
    the tile server operator. Other projects will need to explicitly seek
    permission from the tile server operator.

    The tile stylesheets are available under an open source license at:
    https://github.com/stackunderflow-stackptr/stackptr_tools/tree/master/osm-bright
